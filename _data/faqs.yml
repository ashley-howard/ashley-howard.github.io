- id: mobile-friendly
  question: Will my website look good on mobile too?
  answer: |
    Yes, in fact I like to develop "mobile-first", which basically means I write the code for mobile before I write it for desktop. I can't emphasise enough that mobile-friendly websites are so important, as the average person is more likely to own, or use, a mobile rather than a computer.

- id: platforms
  question: Which platforms do you use?
  answer: |
    I build websites on and off platforms, depending on what you need.

    I have experience working with Wordpress and Shopify. Off platform I'm comfortable building static sites, as well as using frameworks such as Jekyll.

    For anything else, let's have a chat to see if I can do it!

- id: best-platform
  question: Which platform is best for me?
  answer: |
    Each platform brings something different to the table. Let's have a chat and see what would be best for you and your business.

- id: templates
  question: Do you build sites from scratch or use templates?
  answer: |
    I create all my websites from scratch, except for Shopify where I'll usually edit a pre-made theme. If you need something custom, we can talk about bringing a specialist in.

- id: discounts
  question: Do you do discounts?
  answer: |
    I am currently reducing the cost of packages for businesses whose **primary** goal relates to eco-friendliness, education, human rights, or equality.

- id: referrals
  question: What is the referral scheme?
  answer: |
    You receive 10% off every time you **successfully** refer someone to me.

    Note: When their project has been completed and totally paid for. Excluding PAYG and hourly prices. You can collect a max total of 30%.

- id: starting
  question: What do I need before we start?
  answer: |
    A concept, copy, and images.

    - Concept: If you need help with your concept, we can chat over Zoom using a thought-provoking worksheet to bring out the best of your business. If you need extra help or branding, we can bring in a specialist.
    - Copy: If you need help writing something captivating for your site, we can bring in an expert copywriter. If you'd like a website now and fill out the text later, no problem, we can use [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com) which is a useful placeholder for text. Bear in mind that not having your copy ready can influence the website's design.
    - Images: Placeholder images are cool, but professional images are better and make a HUGE difference to your website and brand. We can chat if we should bring in a photographer.

- id: time
  question: Does a website really take that long to make?
  answer: |
    You'll find a lot of different types of web designers online who will give you anything from 24 hours to a couple of months to complete a website.

    As I'm putting a lot of research into your site and experimenting a lot with different mockups, it's only natural that it takes longer than expected. It will be worth it, I promise. The project only ends when you're happy. There's no timer ticking away in the background.

- id: work-alone
  question: Do you work alone?
  answer: |
    Usually I do, but for things like branding or copy I'm happy to bring an expert in.

- id: free-updates
  question: What are the free updates?
  answer: |
    I provide free updates every 6 months, to make sure your website is using the most up-to-date web standards, and that it stays fast and efficient.

    Note: Equivalent of *up to* 24 hours, depending on the work required.

- id: payment-plan
  question: Do you offer a payment plan?
  answer: |
    Yes. If needed, we can split the total over three months.
