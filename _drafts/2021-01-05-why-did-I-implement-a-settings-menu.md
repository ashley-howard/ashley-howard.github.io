... as well as a left-handed mode?

If you were to ask anyone that knows me well, you'd find out that I'm an avid user of mobile apps and have hundreds on my phone. Ranging from social media and games, to productivity and educational apps.

But as a web developer I've noticed something; websites these days are becoming more powerful, yet they still seem to be lacking something.

**Personalisation!**

Now I'm not talking about things like choosing your favourite colour to be the default theme or having a custom cursor (Myspace anyone?). I'm talking more in terms of accessiblity; creating a website that provides a more comfortable experience for the user. 

Mobile apps for example have features such as dark mode, reduced data options, and high contrast, to name a few. (While a few of these exist in CSS (`@media prefers`), not all have been completely implemented yet into browsers.)

## Creating the settings menu

The first thing that came to mind was a native dark mode. By native I mean it follows your device's theme. I ended up implementing three choices:

- System: Follow the user device's theme
- Light: Force a light mode on a device that has dark mode always on
- Dark: For devices that have no native dark mode

Maybe you're asking "Why have light and dark options when there's a system option?" Unfortunately there are still a lot of devices out there which do not have dark theme options. 


Why have forced options? I understand that some people love dark mode, so much so that they keep it on all the time. This is a way 

I liked the idea of having a settings menu. Apps have it, so why can't websites? It's not impossible, and it's not even time-consuming. I mean once you've created your menu, there's nothing stopping you from using it on all of your sites. 

As technology becomes more personalised, it only makes sense I feel, to treat websites how we treat apps. 

**Include some code**

So that's why I'd like to give it a shot. So far I've introduced a colour scheme and left-handed mode. 

## Why did I add a left-handed mode? 

To answer the second question: because I'm left-handed. Okay, well, that's not the complete truth. 

The only thing I do with my left hand is write. It would be easier to consider myself officially right-handed if tomorrow I decided to learn to write with my right hand instead. 

I think I ended up doing most things with my right hand, because well, most things are made for right-handed people. Sure you might have seen left-handed scissors in school, but there weren't many, and so you had to wait your turn. I was a kid, I was impatient. So I ended up using "normal" scissors for "normal" people (can you hear my sarcasm?). That analogy continues for most objects that I'll use throughout my life, and I'm guessing for others too. 

So where am I going with this? 

*Personalisation*. 

We live in a highly technological era. You know how long it took me to implement a Left-handed mode into my site? About 5 minutes. And no I'm not trying to brag, I swear. Okay okay, the time it will take depends on the complexity of the site, so it's understandable that not everyone is doing this. 

I implemented it so that Left-handed people could see it and smile. 

Phones are getting huge, and it's getting harder to reach menus. 

Because I'm left-handed
Because it took less 5 minutes

While we wait for browsers to implement native personalistion options, I absolutely feel that a settings menu is an invaluable tool.
