... as well as a left-handed mode? 

Well to answer the second question: because I'm left-handed. Okay, well, I'm not totally. 

The only thing I do with my left hand is write. It would be easier to consider myself officially right-handed if tomorrow I decided to learn to write with my right hand instead. 

I think I ended up doing most things with my right hand, because well, most things are made for right-handed people. Sure you might have seen left-handed scissors in primary schools, but there weren't many, and so you had to wait your turn. I was a kid, I was impatient. So I ended up using "normal" scissors for "normal" people (can you hear my sarcasm?). That analogy continues for most objects that I'll use throughout my life, and I'm guessing for others too. 

So where am I going with this? 

*Personalisation*. 

We live in a highly technological era. You know how long it took me to implement a Left-handed mode into my site? About 5 minutes. And no I'm not trying to brag, I swear. Okay okay, the time it will take depends on the complexity of the site, so it's understandable that not everyone is doing this. 

I implemented it so that Left-handed people could see it and smile. 

Phones are getting huge, and it's getting harder to reach menus.

Because it took less 5 minutes
I've always loved apps. If you ask anyone that knows me, they know I love apps. I'm always downloading more and more, yet I rarely use them all. I usually tell them that some are for a rainy day or for when I'm stuck on a train without WiFi. 

One thing I've noticed though as a Web dev, is that websites are getting more complicated, yet at what cost? 

More recently companies are creating these beautiful websites with lots of cool tricks and animations, but what they don't realise is that they're making it harder for people with disabilities to use the site. 

I liked the idea of having a settings menu. Apps have it, so why can't websites? It's not impossible, and it's not even time-consuming. I mean once you've created your menu, there's nothing stopping you from using it on all of your sites. 

As technology becomes more personalised, it only makes sense I feel, to treat websites how we treat apps. 

Apps feature things like:

- reduced data
- dark mode
- high contrast 

Include some code 

So that's why I'd like to give it a shot. So far I've introduced a colour scheme and left-handed mode. Are there any features that you'd like to see implemented more in websites?
