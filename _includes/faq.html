        <button id="faq-mobile-friendly" class="accordion__btn">Will my website look good on mobile too?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>Yes, in fact I like to develop "mobile-first", which basically means I write the code for mobile before I
                write it for desktop. I can't emphasise enough that mobile-friendly websites are so important, as the
                average person is more likely to own, or use, a mobile rather than a computer.</p>
        </div>

        <button id="faq-platforms" class="accordion__btn">Which platforms do you use?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>I build websites on and off platforms, depending on what you need.</p>

            <p>
                The platforms I like to use are Wordpress, Webflow, and Shopify. Off platform I'm comfortable building
                static sites, as well as using frameworks such as Jekyll.

        <button id="faq-best-platform" class="accordion__btn">Which platform is best for me?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>
                Each platform brings something different to the table. Let's have a chat and see what would be best for
                you and your business.

        <button id="faq-templates" class="accordion__btn">Do you build sites from scratch or use templates?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>
                I create all my websites from scratch, except for Shopify where I'll usually edit a pre-made theme. If
                you need something custom, we can talk about bringing a specialist in.
            </p>

        <button id="faq-discounts" class="accordion__btn">Do you do discounts?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>I am currently reducing
                the
                cost of
                packages for businesses whose <strong>primary</strong> goal relates to eco-friendliness, education,
                human rights, or
                equality.</p>
        </div>

        <button id="faq-referrals" class="accordion__btn">What is the referral scheme?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>You receive 10% off every time you <strong>successfully</strong> refer someone to me.</p>

            <p>Note: When their project has been completed and totally paid for. Excluding PAYG and hourly prices. You can
                collect a max total of 30%.</p>
        </div>

        <button id="faq-starting" class="accordion__btn">What do I need before we start?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>A concept, copy, and images.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Concept: If you need help with your concept, we can chat over Zoom using a thought-provoking
                    worksheet to bring out the best of your business. If you need extra help or branding, we can bring
                    in a specialist.</li>
                <li>Copy: If you need help writing something captivating for your site, we can bring in an expert
                    copywriter. If you'd like a website now and fill out the text later, no problem, we can use <a
                        href="https://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a> which is a useful placeholder for text. Bear in
                    mind that not having your copy ready can influence the website's design.</li>
                <li>Images: Placeholder images are cool, but professional images are better and make a HUGE difference
                    to your website and brand. We can chat if we should bring in a photographer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <button id="faq-time" class="accordion__btn">Does a website really take that long to make?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>You'll find a lot of different types of web designers online who will give you
                anything from 24
                hours to a couple of months to complete a website.</p>

            <p>As I'm putting a lot of research into your site and experimenting a lot with different mockups, it's only
                natural that it takes longer than expected. It will be worth it, I promise. The project only ends
                when you're happy. There's no timer ticking away in the background.</p>
        </div>

        <button id="faq-work-alone" class="accordion__btn">Do you work alone?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>Usually I do, but for things like branding or copy I'm happy to bring an
                expert in.</p>
        </div>

        <button id="faq-free-updates" class="accordion__btn">What are the free updates?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>
                I provide free updates every 6 months, to make sure your website is using the most up-to-date web standards, and that
                it stays fast and efficient.
            </p>

            <p>Note: Equivalent of <u>up to</u> 24 hours, depending on the work required.</p>
        </div>

        <button id="faq-payment-plan" class="accordion__btn">Do you offer a payment plan?</button>
        <div class="accordion__panel">
            <p>Yes. If needed, we can split the total over three months.</p>
