                I‚Äôm Ash, and I was born and raised in East London. I‚Äôve been a web designer and developer for well over
                10 years now, striving to create refreshing and modern websites, while maintaining my own style; usually
                something simple or minimalistic.

                <p>
                    I've always been interested in creating websites, since I was old enough to use a computer at my
                    local library. I remember making really basic sites and then storing them on floppy
                    disks (remember those?). Unfortunately I misplaced them, but I continued to study and build
                    websites on the side while I did other things. I won't go through all of that now, but I will say
                    that throughout the years I learnt a lot about web design, but also myself, and realised that being
                    a full time web designer was exactly what I wanted to be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being creative plays an important role in my life, and I try to live every day as creatively as
                    possible. Music helps me a lot in the process, although I'm kinda stuck in the '90s... And when I'm
                    trying to concentrate, I go for lo-fi. I'm also passionate about technology, photography, and
                    foreign languages.

            <div>

                <p>
                    If you were to ask to me what type of websites I like to build, I'd probably say simple yet
                    effective. That not only means in the design, but in the message too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I've learnt something over the years while looking at a great deal of websites, is that
                    they've become less verbose, more spacious, and let's say... more to the point. This makes
                    sense, as we live in a fast-paced world with seemingly endless amounts of information to
                    consume, so content needs to be easy-to-read, relatable, and impactful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone has their story to tell, and although a story can be complex, I find it best to start
                    small and work from there. A story doesn't necessary have to be expressed through words either,
                    as colour plays a huge role in the overall feel of a website. That's why when I create a
                    website, I'm extremely meticulous and take every single little thing seriously.

                            Great design comes from telling a story, and I'm here to help you develop a relatable
