            <h1>Privacy Policy for ashley.how</h1>

            <i>(N.B. "we", "us", and "ours", are used to refer to the site owner Ashley Howard and his sole-trader
                web design business)</i>

            <p>The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay
                out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we
                never sell your data: never have, never will.</p>

            <p>This policy applies to all products created and maintained by Ashley Howard.</p>

            <h2 id="what-we-collect-and-why">What we collect and why</h2>

            <p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:</p>

            <h3 id="identity--access">Identity &amp; access</h3>

            <p>When you fill out a form on this website, we typically ask for identifying information such
                as your name, email address, telephone number (optional), and company name (optional). We’ll never sell
                your personal
                info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your
                permission either.
            </p>

            <h3 id="billing-information">Billing information</h3>

            <p>When you pay for a product or service, you can either pay directly (via a bank transfer), or through a
                trusted and secure service (such as Paypal). Your credit card is passed directly
                to the payment processor or bank and never goes through our servers. We store a record of the payment
                transaction, and as-of billing
                address, for
                account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to calculate any sales
                tax due in the United States or VAT in the EU, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to
                print on your invoices.</p>

            <h3 id="geolocation-data">Geolocation data</h3>

            <p>We log full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access or dangerous activies
                have occured on this domain. We keep this data for as long as we need to, in order to keep our website
                safe from spam or attacks.</p>

            <p>We also log full IP addresses when using forms on this domain. We keep this record forever because they
                are used to mitigate spammy signups.</p>

            <p>Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions section — are also tied temporarily to
                IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases. We blind all web analytics data after 30 days.</p>

            <h3 id="website-interactions">Website interactions</h3>

            <p>When you browse particular pages on this domain, your browser automatically shares certain
                information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information,
                along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical
                purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help
                inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address, and we blind all of
                these individual identifiers after 30
                days.</p>

            <h3 id="cookies-and-do-not-track">Cookies and Do Not Track</h3>

            <p>We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our
                applications, and support some in-house analytics. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to
                help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention
                settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been
                set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: <a
                    href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

            <p>At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.
            </p>

            <h3 id="voluntary-correspondence">Voluntary correspondence</h3>

            <p>When you write to Ashley Howard with a question or ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including
                the
                email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the
                future.</p>

            <p>We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we
                may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you
                give your express consent.</p>

            <h3 id="information-we-do-not-collect">Information we do not collect</h3>

            <p>We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion,
                sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or
                disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in
                your email signature when contacting us.</p>

            <h2 id="when-we-access-or-share-your-information">When we access or share your information</h2>

            <p>Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your
                info are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>To provide products or services you've requested</strong>. We do use some third-party
                    services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your
                    personal information via these third parties.
                    Having subprocessors means
                    we are using technology to access your data. Our third-party processors can be viewed <a
                        href="/policies/subprocessors">here</a>.</li>

                <li><strong>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.</strong> If at any
                    point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent
                    before proceeding.</li>

                <li><strong>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.</strong> Accessing a
                    customer’s account
                    when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the
                    privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to
                    balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products
                    for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.</li>

                <li><strong>When required under applicable law.</strong> If the appropriate law enforcement authorities
                    have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to
                    comply. Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek
                    data. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are
                    made. <strong><em>We have never received a National Security Letter or Foreign Intelligence
                            Surveillance Act (FISA) order.</em></strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>If we are acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens
                — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different
                privacy policy.</p>

            <h2 id="location-of-site-and-data">Location of Site and Data</h2>

            <p>Our products and other web properties are operated in the United Kingdom. If you are located in the
                European Union or elsewhere outside of the United Kingdom, please be aware that any information you
                provide to us will be transferred to the United Kingdom. By using our Site, participating in any of our
                services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>

            <h2 id="your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information">Your Rights With Respect to Your Information</h2>

            <p>We apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some
                of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection
                Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. We recognize all of
                the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected,
                    used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well
                    as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we
                    gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and
                    processing of that information.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request correction of your personal
                    information.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to
                    certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our
                    possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion
                    requests may prevent you from using our services because our applications may then no longer
                    work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of
                    your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific
                    authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a
                        href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and
                    why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal
                    information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data).</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why
                    your personal information is processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive the personal information we
                    have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to object
                    and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being
                    made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is
                    necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is
                    based on your explicit consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not
                    charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a
                    lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the
                    exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising
                    those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.</p>

            <p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a
                    href="mailto:contact@ashley.how">contact@ashley.how</a>. For requests to delete personal information
                or know what
                personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at
                least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized
                agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the
                account holder before proceeding.</p>

            <p>If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about
                GDPR, at <a
                    href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.
            </p>

            <h2 id="how-we-secure-your-data">How we secure your data</h2>

            <p>All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a>
                when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted.</p>

            <p>For products, most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to
                be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.</p>


            <h3 id="we-commit-to-resolving-all-complaints">We commit to resolving all complaints</h3>

            <p>We commit to resolve complaints
                about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union, United
                Kingdom, or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should contact
                us at <a href="mailto:contact@ashley.how">contact@ashley.how</a>.</p>

            <p>If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
                complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit

            <p>If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through these described channels, under certain
                conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress
                mechanisms. To learn more, please view the Privacy Shield Annex 1 at <a
