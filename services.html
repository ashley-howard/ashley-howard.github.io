            <div class="section">
                <p>Depending on your needs, I can create either a static, CMS-based, or e-commerce website. Below I'll
                    explain each one and list their pros and cons. And below that I'll outline the steps.</p>

                <h2>Static website - simplest option for content that doesn't need updating often</h2>

                <span>Pros</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Great for simple websites, if you just want to show off some info about your business or project
                    </li>
                    <li>Cost-effective; I can set it up on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github
                            pages</a>, which means free hosting, so you just pay for the
                        domain each year
                    </li>
                    <li>Loads quickly (when coded efficiently)</li>
                </ul>

                <span>Cons</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not well-suited for e-commerce or blogs</li>
                    <li>Not as friendly to edit as a CMS; you may need me to update text if necessary (we can chat about
                        that)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>CMS (content management system) - manage your website easily without too much technical skill</h2>
                <span>Pros</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recommended for bloggers, and those who’d like to update their website regularly</li>
                    <li>Can be integrated with e-commerce features; but not as elaborate as using an e-commerce website
                        itself (see below)</li>
                </ul>

                <span>Cons</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unlike static websites, you’ll pay for hosting</li>
                    <li>Making sure to update plug-ins and install security updates</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>E-commerce - manage your online shop</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>For e-commerce I like to use Shopify, but if you had something else in mind feel free
                        to let me know. It can be integrated into Wordpress, which is cheaper but has
                        fewer
                    </li>
                    features. For professional e-commerce businesses I recommend using Shopify straight-up. I can
                    explain
                    the
                    “price tiers” too if you need help.</li>
                </ul>

            <span>Steps</span>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="section">
                <h2>1) Requirements</h2>
                <p>First we'll talk as much as possible about your business or project and any ideas you may already
                    have for it - including your goals and the main functions of your website.
                    The better understanding we have with one another, the better the outcome will be!
                </p>

                <p>I'll need as many details as possible in order to give you a quotation and an approximate
                    time of completion.</p>

                <p>If you decide to go ahead with our collaboration, I'll send you an invoice asking for an initial
                    payment of 50%. When
                    it's been made I'll be ready to begin working on your project.</p>

                <h2>2) Research</h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is research into your business. Looking at other similar businesses will give me an
                    idea
                    of how to structure your website and most importantly how to make it stand out.
                </p>

                <p>Meanwhile, I'll expect you to provide the content (text, photos, etc.) for your website. If you need
                    some
                    help in creating content, I can liaise you with a relevant professional.</p>

                <h2>3) Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Now we're onto the design stage.

                    Depending on the project, I'll either create static or interactive mockups to let you see my
                    progress, and ask for your feedback. Any kind of criticism is okay, but constructive is the best, as
                    it
                    allows us to keep moving forward creatively.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you're happy with the initial design, we can move onto the development stage. All the while,
                    communicating regularly and giving feedback on the project.
                </p>

                <h2>4) Development & Testing</h2>

                <p>
                    This is the part where I test your website on various devices, screen sizes, and browsers, before
                    launching.</p>

                <h2>5) Deployment & Wrapping up</h2>
                <p>
                    When all our hard work is done, we can deploy your website to the world! If necessary, especially
                    for CMS or e-commerce websites, I can train and help you get familar with your new website so you
                    can add/edit/etc. content with ease.
                </p>
