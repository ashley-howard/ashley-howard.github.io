## Intro paragraph

Nunc purus sit gravida fames. Tristique fermentum, molestie porttitor ut sapien egestas cursus. Pretium, sollicitudin a odio cras vulputate metus, nunc a.

### Reducing the amount of text

Nunc purus sit gravida fames. Tristique fermentum, molestie porttitor ut sapien egestas cursus. Pretium, sollicitudin a odio cras vulputate metus, nunc a.

## Case studies

### Fullscreen images
When creating a website, width constraints are really important. They not only keep the layout under control when you have a screen that's larger than you designed for, but it makes things easier to read as your eyes don't need to travel so far when reading left to right. The only "problem" with this is that images are also constrained. As I wanted my case study images to take the spotlight, I decided to move all the images outside of my container (with a 1200px width), so they fit any screen responsively. 

Note: I know this can create an annoying layout shift, so I'm working on a solution.

## Semantics
As I wanted to be as semantic as possible, I did my best to make use of some HTML5 tags that I wasn't using in my previous portfolio. This is especially great for screen readers and SEO. Do let me know if you've found something on my site that you think should be using a different HTML tag.
