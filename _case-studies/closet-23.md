Closet 23 is an online clothing store which features niche luxury brands & styles from fashion capitals all over the world, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and France.

## The brief

Tina came to me asking for a redesign of her current Wix site. She needed a fresh modern website to go up against her competitors, something to suit her luxury brand. Fortunately she had a huge selection of high-quality photos for me to play with, as well as a detailed plan of what she needed. 

## The design

{% include picture.html img="closet-23-after" ext="jpg" alt="the homepage of a clothing site" width="1920" height="1080" %}

<img src="/assets/images/case-studies/closet-23/closet-23-boys.jpg" alt="the boys page of a clothing site" height="1080" width="1920">

### The theme

For the theme, Tina wanted to keep the pink from her previous design but make it a bit darker, so in the new design I implement this new pink in some decorations and accents across the site.

### The main slideshow

Making use of Tina's collection of stunning imagery, I made the landing page feature a slideshow of high-res photos showing off her luxurious clothing range. This also gave her the opportunity to show off seasonal products and offers, and update them as she pleases.

### Filtering and sorting

- Goal: Allow customers to find what they need easier
- Solution: Add filtering and sorting options

Tina wanted her customers to be able to sort and filter products easily, so I added a filter for prices, colours, sizes, as well as the ability to sort them. I used Wix's built-in options for that.

### Increasing engagement

- Goal: Keep customers on the site for longer
- Solution: Add "related products" on product pages, as well as more categories on the homepage

Throughout the site, I implemented more opportunities for customers to  see products that perhaps they wouldn't have seen otherwise, increasing their engagement and giving them the chance to add more items to their basket.

Also because of this, Tina told me that she managed to get rid of some old stock!

### Increasing reach

- Goal: Localise site to accommodate customers outside the UK
- Solution: Offer alternative currency and language options

Her site now provides a huge selection of currency options, and allows customers to view the site in Arabic.
